# First-Homework-01
This Assignment was very useful for me, In this Assignment I learnet when and where to use Semantic Elements, and how to connect them with our CSS file and our Assets.
After using appropiate elements, and linking diffirent items together, I think my code is talking with me and it's way easier for SEO and browsers to read it.
